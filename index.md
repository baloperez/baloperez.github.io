### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 2 was my personal favorite lab because before taking this course, I learned Python 3.0 and I worked a lot on trying to make a Blackjack simulator. I was never able to complete it, but this lab brought back that memory along with the steps on how to code the functions I needed. By far, this lab was the most fun, my partner was really cool and easy to work with, allowing a faster pace to move through the lab.

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 1 was another one of my top picks because of the simplicity of what we were being asked to code. Five weeks in, I was starting to get the hang of c++ and I was able to apply simple math and logic into the code for the area of a rectangle. Everything made clear sense to me and I appreciated a simple part of this lab, which prepares my brain to handle the second part.

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 1 is my final pick, due to the instructions we had to follow for the code. A real life scenario was applied with vehicle parking rules and we were required to set limitations in for loops various times. I struggled a bit with the order and choice of symbols, but I learned a lot from trial and error, improving my abilities to understand what symbols are going to be needed when setting restrictions.
